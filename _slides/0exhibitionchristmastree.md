This slide was given to Joe as a gift for Christmas 1997. I believe this arrangement may have been made by [Klaus Kemp (1937-2022)](https://diatomsamples.weebly.com/klaus-kemp-in-memoriam.html), a specialist in diatom microslides and diatom arrangements, based on similarities in typography and smilarity to other works by Kemp [such as this](https://www.quekett.org/resources/article-archive/christmas-slides) and [this](https://microscope-antiques.com/arrangements.html).
