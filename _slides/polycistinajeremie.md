Polycistina or polycystines are a group of [radiolarians, unicellular eukaryotes that produce intricate mineral skeletons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolaria).

These are presumably from Jeremie, Haiti, based on the text annotation and also how [polycystines from Jeremie in Haiti were a subject of a book by Alfredo Truan Y Luard and Otto N. Witt](http://www.microscopist.net/WittOtto.html). I suspect that neither Alfredo Truan Y Luard nor Otto N. Witt prepared this slide since the text is in English while Luard and Witt wrote in German. So the preparer is unclear.
